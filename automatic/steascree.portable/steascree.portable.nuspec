    <summary>Steam Cloud Screenshot Uploader</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[
SteaScree is a simple cross-platform open-source utility tool, which greatly simplifies the uploading of screenshots to the Steam Cloud, which were taken without the use of Steam's in-game overlay. You just pick pics, select game and SteaScree will do the rest.

__The problem__: every Steam user has 20 GB of cloud space specifically for a screenshot storing. But not every screenshot can be easily uploaded to the Steam Cloud, since the files should have been created by Steam in-game overlay, thus have a specific filename, reside in specific Steam directories and be registered within a special screenshots.vdf file. Steam fails to upload custom screenshots returning Steam
